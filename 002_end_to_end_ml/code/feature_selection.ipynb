    "While preparing your data for modeling, it is important to ensure that you have a set of helpful features for the model to base its predictions (or diagnosis) on. In order to be helpful, features need to capture essential characteristics of the heart disease dataset in an orthogonal way; more data isn't always better! <br>\n",
